I come from outside of Philadelphia, PA. I have worked on several different projects for a couple different companies/ organizations and really enjoy working in a professional setting of web design. I like to spend my free time playing games, solo or multi, and working on side projects and/or 3D models. Before going away to college, I would volunteer time at and enter cacti into the Philadelphia Flower Show.",
